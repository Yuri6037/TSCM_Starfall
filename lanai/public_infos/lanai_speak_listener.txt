--Wanting to listen to LanAI ? Easy just follow those steps :
--First you have to write a script that renders string messages like chat system,
--Second just hook to that channel on server : LanAI_MessageSpoken, cf example :

	--Now you need this code to retrieve the message as string. NOTE : the message can be null.
	local args = {...}
	local msg = args[2] --Here you go this is the message as string you may want to draw.
	local ply = args[3] --This is the player that should normaly receive the message.
